## Integration Paths

This project is a bridge layer with two consumer paths:

1. **MCP Server path:**
   - **RemNote Automation Bridge** (this project): RemNote plugin exposing RemNote API via WebSocket
   - **[RemNote MCP Server](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)**: companion server exposing MCP tools to AI
     assistants
   - Demo: **[View MCP Server Demo →](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/demo.md)**
2. **CLI app path (e.g. for OpenClaw):**
   - This bridge plugin remains the RemNote endpoint
   - **[RemNote CLI](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-cli)**: companion app for integrating RemNote with OpenClaw and
     other agentic workflows via the same WebSocket bridge
   - Demo: **[View RemNote CLI Demo →](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-cli/blob/main/docs/demo.md)**

**For both paths always 2 components are required - the bridge and either the MCP server or the CLI app.**

**Version compatibility warning (`0.x` semver):** install a server/CLI version that matches your installed bridge plugin version (prefer the same minor line). See the [Bridge / Consumer Version Compatibility Guide](docs/guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md).

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard by Anthropic that allows AI assistants
to interact with external tools and data sources. With this plugin, your AI assistant becomes a true PKM companion.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Create Notes & Flashcards** - Create simple notes, hierarchical markdown trees, or RemNote-native flashcards
- **Search Knowledge Base** - Full-text search across your Rems, plus tag-based search with ancestor context
- **Read Notes** - Read notes with markdown or structured child content for follow-up navigation
- **Update Notes** - Rename notes, append or replace hierarchical content, and manage tags
- **Daily Journal** - Append entries to today's daily document, including hierarchical markdown content

### Plugin Features

- **Sidebar Control Panel** - Monitor Automation Bridge connection status, statistics, and action history
- **Auto-tagging** - Automatically tag notes created via Automation Bridge actions (configurable)
- **Session Statistics** - Track created/updated/journal entries/searches
- **Action History** - View last 10 bridge actions with timestamps
- **Configurable Settings** - Customize behavior through RemNote settings
- **Real-time Status** - Live connection status indicator in sidebar panel

## Data Privacy

This plugin connects your RemNote knowledge base to AI assistants through a **locally running MCP server** (installed
separately from this plugin). Here's the data flow:

**RemNote ↔ Local MCP Server ↔ AI Assistant**

- The plugin communicates exclusively with your local MCP server via WebSocket (default: `ws://127.0.0.1:3002`)
- The MCP server forwards data to your AI assistant (Claude, GPT, etc.) using the MCP protocol
- **The plugin itself does NOT send data to external servers** - all external communication happens through your local
  MCP server

Your RemNote data is only shared with the AI assistant you've configured in your MCP server setup. The plugin acts as
a local bridge and has no built-in external network access beyond the local WebSocket connection.

For technical details about the security model, see the [RemNote MCP Server Security
Model](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/architecture.md#security-model) documentation.

## Installation

### 1. Install the RemNote Plugin (This Repository)

Choose the install path that fits your use case:

- **Recommended for most users (marketplace install):**
  - [Install the Plugin via RemNote Marketplace (Beginner Guide)](docs/guides/install-plugin-via-marketplace-beginner.md)
- **For developers / local plugin testing from source:**
  - [Run The Plugin Locally (Beginner Guide)](docs/guides/development-run-plugin-locally.md)

After plugin installation (either path), the bridge starts automatically when the plugin activates in RemNote. You can
optionally open the control panel to inspect status and logs:

- Look for the **Automation Bridge** icon in RemNote's right sidebar toolbar
- Click the icon to open the Automation Bridge panel

The sidebar panel is no longer required to create the connection. It is a monitoring and manual-control surface for the
background bridge runtime.

- [Execute Bridge Commands from RemNote Developer Console (Screenshot Walkthrough)](docs/guides/development-execute-bridge-commands-screenshots.md)

### 2. Install the MCP Server

**Important:** The plugin alone is not sufficient - you must also install the [RemNote MCP
Server](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server), which connects your AI assistant to this plugin.

Install the server globally:

> **Version compatibility (important):** before installing/upgrading the MCP server (or the CLI companion), check the [Bridge / Consumer Version Compatibility Guide](docs/guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md).

```bash
npm install -g remnote-mcp-server
```

For detailed installation instructions, configuration, and troubleshooting, see the **[RemNote MCP Server
repository](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)**.

Alternative companion path (instead of MCP server): use **[RemNote CLI](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-cli)** for
OpenClaw and other agentic workflows. Installation and demo links are included in both plugin install guides above.
For version matching across bridge/server/CLI releases, use the [Bridge / Consumer Version Compatibility Guide](docs/guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md).

### Recommended Startup Order

1. Start the companion process first:
   - `remnote-mcp-server` for the MCP path
   - `remnote-cli daemon start` for the CLI path
2. Open RemNote.
3. Wait for the bridge to connect in the background, or open the Automation Bridge panel if you want to confirm status.
4. Only then start using your MCP client or `remnote-cli` commands.

If RemNote was already open before the companion process started, the bridge will continue low-frequency background
retries and should connect automatically once the companion process is listening. The **Reconnect** button in the
sidebar panel remains available as a manual fast-path if you want an immediate retry.

## Important Limitations

**Multiple AI agents can connect to the MCP server simultaneously**, but the system enforces a **single RemNote plugin
connection**. This means:

- Multiple AI assistants (e.g., multiple Claude Code sessions) can access the same RemNote knowledge base concurrently
- The MCP server uses HTTP Streamable transport, supporting multiple concurrent client sessions
- However, only one RemNote app instance can be connected at a time via the WebSocket bridge
- This is a RemNote plugin limitation, not an MCP server limitation

For technical details about multi-agent support and connection architecture, see the **[RemNote MCP Server
documentation](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server#multi-agent-support)**.

## Configuration

Access plugin settings in RemNote via **Settings > Plugins > Automation Bridge (OpenClaw, CLI, MCP...)**:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Accept write operations | Allow write actions (`create_note`, `update_note`, `append_journal`) | `true` |
| Accept replace operation | Allow destructive `update_note` replace operations | `false` |
| Auto-tag created notes | Add a tag to notes created via bridge actions | `true` |
| Auto-tag name | Tag name for auto-tagged created notes | `` |
| Journal entry prefix | Optional prefix for journal entries | `` |
| Add timestamp to journal | Include time in journal entries | `true` |
| WebSocket server URL | Automation bridge server connection URL | `ws://127.0.0.1:3002` |
| Default parent Rem ID | Parent for new notes (empty = root) | `` |

## MCP Tools Available

Once connected, your AI assistant can use these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remnote_create_note` | Create notes, markdown trees, or flashcards with title, content, parent, and tags |
| `remnote_search` | Search the knowledge base with query and filters |
| `remnote_search_by_tag` | Search by tag with ancestor context and content controls |
| `remnote_read_note` | Read a note's content in markdown or structured form by ID |
| `remnote_update_note` | Update title, append or replace content, add/remove tags |
| `remnote_append_journal` | Add hierarchical markdown content to today's daily document |
| `remnote_status` | Check connection status |

## Usage

### Opening the Control Panel

The bridge control panel is accessible via the right sidebar:

1. Locate the **Automation Bridge icon** in RemNote's right sidebar toolbar
2. Click the icon to open the control panel in the sidebar
3. The panel displays:
   - **Connection Status** - Current WebSocket connection state
   - **Session Statistics** - Counts of created notes, updates, journal entries, and searches
   - **Action History** - Last 10 bridge actions with timestamps
   - **Recent Logs** - Real-time activity log
4. The panel remains visible while you navigate RemNote (non-blocking)
5. Click the icon again to close the panel

The connection logic runs in the background even when the panel is closed.

The sidebar panel provides persistent monitoring of bridge connection and activity while you work in RemNote.

### Example AI Interactions

Once everything is connected, you can ask your AI assistant things like:

- *Create a note about the meeting we just had*
- *Search my notes in RemNote for information about AI coding*
- *Add a journal entry: Finished the MCP integration today!*
- *Find all my notes tagged with 'Ideas' and summarize them*
- *Update my 'Reading List' note with this new book*

## Architecture

```text
AI Assistant (Claude Code/Desktop) ↔ MCP Server (HTTP) ↔ WebSocket :3002 ↔ RemNote Plugin (this repo) ↔ RemNote SDK
```

**Component roles:**

- **RemNote MCP Server** ([separate repository](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)) - Exposes MCP tools to
  AI assistants and manages WebSocket server
- **RemNote Automation Bridge** (this repository) - RemNote plugin that connects to the server and executes
  operations via RemNote SDK

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode (hot reload)
npm run dev

# Run development helper script (same hot-reload workflow)
./run-dev.sh

# Run production bundle locally (no zip, no hot reload)
./run-prod-build.sh

# Build for production
npm run build

# The plugin zip will be created as PluginZip.zip
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Issues

**Plugin won't connect:**

1. **Verify plugin settings in RemNote:**
   - WebSocket URL: `ws://127.0.0.1:3002` (default)
   - Check that MCP Server is running
2. **Check plugin console (RemNote Developer Tools):**

   ```text
   Cmd+Option+I (macOS)
   Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux)
   ```

3. **Restart RemNote** after changing settings

**"Invalid event setCustomCSS" errors:**

- Currently observed in hot-reload development runs (`npm run dev` or `./run-dev.sh`)
- Appears non-blocking (bridge functionality continues after dismissing the overlay)
- For production-style local verification, use `./run-prod-build.sh` (no hot reload)
- Treat this as current observed behavior, not a permanent guarantee across SDK/runtime updates

**Notes not appearing:**

- Check if a default parent ID is set (might be creating under a specific Rem)
- Verify the auto-tag setting isn't filtering your view

### Server Issues

For server-related troubleshooting (installation, configuration, port conflicts, MCP tools not appearing in
AI assistant), see the **[RemNote MCP Server
documentation](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server#troubleshooting)**.
