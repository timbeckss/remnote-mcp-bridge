# Pull Request Guide

Use this guide when opening or updating pull requests for `remnote-mcp-bridge`.

This repository is part of a three-repo bridge surface:

- `remnote-mcp-bridge`
- `remnote-mcp-server`
- `remnote-cli`

When a feature or protocol change affects more than one repo, the pull requests must stay in sync.

Use the [repository pull request template](../../.github/pull_request_template.md) for the submission checklist.
This guide explains the cross-repo policy behind that checklist.
that checklist.

## Cross-Repo Parity

If you change the shared bridge protocol, action surface, or behavior expected by consumers, keep `remnote-mcp-server`
and `remnote-cli` in parity as far as the feature allows.

Typical parity-triggering changes:

- New bridge action or CLI/server command
- Request or response schema changes
- Compatibility or handshake changes
- New validation or behavior that a consumer must understand

When parity is affected:

- Open pull requests in all relevant repos.
- Link the related pull requests to each other.
- Keep documentation and tests aligned across the affected repos.

Do not merge a bridge-only protocol change while the companion repos are left behind without an explicit, documented
reason.

## Integration Test Expectations

Integration tests are meant to validate the real bridge-consumer combination:

- bridge + MCP server
- bridge + CLI

If a new feature belongs on the shared external surface, extend integration coverage in both companion repos where the feature can be exercised.

If integration coverage depends on a live RemNote object that cannot yet be created through the companion, document
the temporary setup and keep the test automated as far as possible.
